# FivemNatives

to the natives: https://github.com/DrLeak/FivemNatives/wiki

the natives have not been written for every programming language. Every programming language works differently. With LUA, for example, the first letter is always capitalized, then the letter is again lowercase and only after the first underscore the next letter is capitalized again. If you have no knowledge of how the native needs to be written, then you should look for examples in the forum.
